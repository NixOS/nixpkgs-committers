# Nixpkgs Committer management script testing

The recommended way to test these scripts is to run them in a GitHub test organisation with the right setup.
Since creating your own takes some time, you can just ask @infinisil to get added to his test setup instead,
whose identifiers will be used here.

## Setup

### One-time

- [infinisil-test-org](https://github.com/infinisil-test-org): A GitHub organisation you're part of
- Repositories:
  - [infinisil-test-org/empty](https://github.com/infinisil-test-org/empty): An empty one with no activity on it
  - [infinisil-test-org/active](https://github.com/infinisil-test-org/active): One where you have some activity
  - [infinisil-test-org/nixpkgs-committers](https://github.com/infinisil-test-org/nixpkgs-committers): A fork of the upstream repo

  Useful to keep the first two separate for testing, because it's not possible to "undo" activity on a repo.
- [@infinisil-test-org/actors](https://github.com/orgs/infinisil-test-org/teams/actors): A team you're part of, needs write access to the `active` and `nixpkgs-committers` repository

### Per-user

Once you have the above setup (or got @infinisil to add yourself to his), you have to prepare the following:

- Add some activity of yours to the `active` repo.
  To cover all code branches it's recommended to create, push to and delete a branch.
  You can do this from the web interface.
- Get the GitHub CLI available (`pkgs.github-cli`) and authenticate it using `gh auth login`

## Testing `sync.sh`

This script has no external effects and as such can be easily tested by running:

```bash
scripts/sync.sh infinisil-test-org actors members
```

Check that it synchronises the files in the `members` directory with the team members of the `actors` team.

## `retire.sh`

This script has external effects and as such needs a bit more care when testing.

### Setup (important!)

To avoid other users getting pings, ensure that the `members` directory contains only your own user, then commit and push it for testing:

```bash
me=$(gh api /user --jq .login)
git switch -c "test-$me"
rm -rf members
mkdir members
touch "members/$me"
git add members
git commit -m testing
git push -u git@github.com:infinisil-test-org/nixpkgs-committers HEAD
```

### Test sequence

The following sequence tests all code paths:

1. Run the script with the `active` repo argument to simulate CI running without inactive users:
   ```bash
   scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org active nixpkgs-committers members 'yesterday 1 month ago'
   ```

   Check that no PR would be opened.
2. Run the script with the `empty` repo argument to simulate CI running with inactive users:

   ```bash
   scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org empty nixpkgs-committers members 'yesterday 1 month ago'
   ```

   Check that it would create a PR before running it again with `PROD=1` to actually do it:

   ```bash
   PROD=1 scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org empty nixpkgs-committers members 'yesterday 1 month ago'
   ```

   Check that it created the PR appropriately.
   You can undo this step by closing the PR.
3. Run it again to simulate CI running again later:
   ```bash
   PROD=1 scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org empty nixpkgs-committers members 'yesterday 1 month ago'
   ```
   Check that no other PR is opened.
4. Run it again with `now` as the date to simulate the time interval passing:
   ```bash
   PROD=1 scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org empty nixpkgs-committers members now
   ```
   Check that it undrafted the previous PR and posted an appropriate comment.
5. Run it again to simulate CI running again later:
   ```bash
   PROD=1 scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org empty nixpkgs-committers members now
   ```
6. Reset by marking the PR as a draft again.
7. Run it again with the `active` repo argument to simulate activity during the time interval:
   ```bash
   PROD=1 scripts/retire.sh infinisil-test-org active nixpkgs-committers members now
   ```
